# Random-Number-Guess
The Random Number Guessing Game is a web-based project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where players guess a randomly generated number. The game provides instant feedback, counts attempts, and offers a replay option. It showcases DOM manipulation, logic, and interactivity in web design.
The Random Number Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the computer randomly selects a number within a given range (for example, 1–100), and the player tries to guess it in as few attempts as possible. After each guess, the game provides feedback—indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct—making the experience interactive and fun.
This project demonstrates core web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and user interface design.

🧠 Key Features:

🎲 Generates a random number automatically using JavaScript.
💬 Provides instant feedback on each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
🔢 Displays the number of attempts taken by the user.
🔁 Option to restart and play again without reloading the page.
🎨 Styled with CSS for a clean and responsive design.
⚡ Interactive experience powered by JavaScript events and DOM updates.

🧩 Technologies Used:

HTML5 – for structuring the web page.
CSS3 – for styling, layout, and animations.
JavaScript (ES6) – for implementing game logic and interactivity.

🚀 How It Works:

The player enters a guess number through an input field.
JavaScript compares the player’s input with the randomly generated number.
Feedback is displayed instantly:
If the guess is too high, the player is prompted to try a lower number.
If the guess is too low, the player is prompted to try a higher number.
If the guess is correct, the game congratulates the player and shows the total attempts.
The user can click a “Play Again” button to restart the game.

🏆 Learning Outcomes:

Improved understanding of DOM manipulation and JavaScript event handling.
Learned how to generate random values using Math.random().
Enhanced skills in responsive web design and user interaction.
Strengthened logical thinking and debugging skills.
